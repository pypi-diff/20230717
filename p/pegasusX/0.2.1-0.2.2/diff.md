+Welcome to PegasusX, the latest and most advanced package for creating high-quality embeddings from multimodal data. We're pushing the boundaries of what's possible with machine learning, enabling tasks and applications that were once mere visions of the future.
 
-In essence, Pegasus is designed to transform the way we look at data. Our aim is to make it easier for anyone, regardless of their domain or discipline, to generate task-specific, high-quality embeddings from any type of data, be it text, image, video, audio, or even more complex data types.

-## The Vision
+## Installation
+```bash
+pip install pegasusx
+```
 
-When we began crafting Pegasus, we asked ourselves a fundamental question: What if an algorithm could see and understand all the modalities of data the same way we do, and even beyond?
+## Usage
 
-The answer lies in Pegasus. Powered by a unique blend of artificial intelligence and machine learning, Pegasus is capable of parsing and comprehending multi-modal data types, generating valuable insights in the process.
+```python
+from pegasus import Pegasus
 
-Much like the mythical creature it's named after, Pegasus is all about bridging worlds - in our case, the world of raw, multi-modal data and the world of actionable, contextualized information.
+# for video, audio do "Pegasus('vision'), Pegasus("audio") respectively then pass in the file path of the vision or audio data
+pegasus = Pegasus("text", multi_process=False, n_processes=4)
 
-## The Features
+text_data = ['This is a query about artificial intelligence',
+             'Another query about machine learning',
+             'Yet another query about deep learning',
+             'And one more about natural language processing']
 
-Pegasus is not just another run-of-the-mill machine learning model. We've painstakingly crafted this framework, ensuring it includes features that set it apart:
+embeddings = pegasus.embed_data(text_data)
 
-1. **Multimodal Data Understanding:** From text to images, audio, and more, Pegasus is designed to handle and understand a wide array of data types.
+print(embeddings)
+```
 
-2. **Personalized for Any Task:** Pegasus adapts to your specific task, generating high-quality, task-specific embeddings for a wide variety of applications.
+## Features
 
-3. **Scalability & Performance:** Pegasus has been optimized for efficiency and can scale according to the demands of your tasks, ensuring seamless operation even with large amounts of data.

 ## Roadmap
 
-Pegasus is a constant work in progress, and we're always striving for better. Our roadmap provides a snapshot of where we're heading. This iterative, continuous improvement process is fundamental to achieving our goal of creating the most effective SOTA omni-modality embeddings model. 
-
-### Phase 1: Reconfiguring the ImageBind Model
-
-To improve our handling of diverse data, we are reconfiguring the ImageBind model to utilize Flash Attention. This shift will allow us to manage longer context lengths and handle more complex inputs effectively.
-
-### Phase 2: Pretraining with Diverse Datasets
-
-Quality embeddings require quality training. To ensure our model is versatile and robust, we're pretraining Pegasus using the same datasets that ImageBind has been trained on. This step ensures our model inherits the benefits of proven training methodologies while also incorporating our enhancements.
-
-### Phase 3: Benchmarking
-
-It's important to know where we stand. After we've reconfigured and pretrained our model, we will conduct comprehensive benchmarking tests. This process will highlight any areas of strength or potential improvement, allowing us to further refine our model.
-
-### Phase 4: Finetuning on Long Samples
-
-We believe that Pegasus can handle more than short snippets of data. To prove this, we'll finetune our model using long data samples, pushing the boundaries of what's possible with embedding models.
-
-### Phase 5: Continued Innovation
+PegasusX is a constant work in progress, and we're always striving for better. Our roadmap provides a snapshot of where we're heading.
